**Abstract**

In this paper, we describe our submission to the WMT 2021 Metrics Shared Task. We use the automatically-generated questions and answers to evaluate the quality of Machine Translation (MT) systems. Our submission builds upon the recently proposed MTEQA framework. Experiments on WMT20 evaluation datasets show that at the system-level the MTEQA metric achieves performance comparable with other state-of-the-art solutions, while considering only a certain amount of information from the whole translation.
